# Advent of Code 2025

## Haskell
This repo uses Haskell to solve the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025) problems for 2025! I do not know Haskell, and this is my attempt to learn. This repo was cloned from [a haskell template](https://github.com/lsmor/template-advent-of-code/tree/main) which is where the `aoc-hs` script came from.

## Day 1
This problem was useful for me to learn the syntax and structure of a Haskell program. Very basic implementation logic, but a great introduction

## Day 2
This day I decided to take advantage of Haskell's infinite lists, and some list functions (namely `mergeAll`). The solution was fun and relies on no string manipulation, but does require the `integerLog10` function which may have some performance issues. I am still working to implement benchmarks at this point.
